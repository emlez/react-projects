# React Projects

This is a collection of React projects that I have created while learning React with the help of the [Midudev's - Learning React](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) stream on Twitch.

The base projects (integer directories) are the ones that I have created while following the stream with Vite and React.js.

And the projects in the derivative directories are the ones that I have created on my own, with TypeScript, Tailwind and any tech I'd like to throw in the mix ðŸ§ª(directories with decimals on them).
